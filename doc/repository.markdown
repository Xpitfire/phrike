# Project Structure

### Programming Language
Our main programming language is [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/618ayhy6.aspx) with the [.NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg145045%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).

### IDE
The IDE of choise is [Visual Studio Professional 2013](https://www.dreamspark.com/Product/Product.aspx?productid=93) downloadable at DreamSpark for free for students or we can directly use the new [Visual Studio Community 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com) version.

### GitLab / [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
To clone, commit or checkout project source code we use GitLab in combination with Atlassian [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com).

### Bug Tracking
GitLab provides a simple bug tracking engine ("issues"), to allow users to report bugs. However, on 2015-03-12, we have decided not to use this tool.

### Wiki
GitLab includes a small Wiki documentation engine, to easily sumarize project related key points. To style GitLab Wiki pages the built-in editor uses a markup language called [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics).

### [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics)
A markup language to style Wiki pages or Trello cards.

### Gaming-Engine
We decided to use [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/).
