### Introduction

Operation Phrike has been created by students from the University of Applied Sciences Upper-Austria (Bachelor Software Engineering). It is basically a simulation software for military virtual reality combat scenarios. To create an authentic battlefield experience we use the Oculus Rift in combination with the Unreal Gameing-Engine. During the simulation process the test subject, usually a military representative, is monitored by different sensors to detect his experienced stress level. The collected data will be analyzed and used to extract information, which shows how a human reacts in certain war zone situations.
